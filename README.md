# PixelStitch
PixelStitch is a needlepoint-style renderer for 8-bit style pixel designs.

## Premise
Graphics processor that takes 4-bit, pixel art designs and adapts them to a needlepoint grid that changes with each animation frame - giving the impression that each frame is its own organic needlepoint canvas.

## Method
The previous description is no longer accurate. I'll come back and rewrite this later.

## Intended applications
- Standalone graphics rendering tool
- Graphics rendering for Godot game engine
- Web-based graphics renderer
